I write when I am unsure about something and need to properly think it through. I find that writing and the process of editing helps me understand how things relate to each other.

Sadly, I am unsure about many things, but I don't write very often. This is an unfortunate balance I hope this blog will help me correct: Having a place for the writing to live that isn't a notion page feels like it will make me write more. Let's see if I am right.
