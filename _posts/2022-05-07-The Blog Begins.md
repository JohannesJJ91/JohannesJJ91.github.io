I write when I am unsure about something and need to properly think it through. I find that writing and the process of editing helps me understand how things relate to each other.

Sadly, I am unsure about many things, but I don't write very often. This is an unfortunate balance I hope this blog will help me correct.

I have recently shared some of my blog posts with friends, and they have encouraged me to publish them. So, here it goes!
