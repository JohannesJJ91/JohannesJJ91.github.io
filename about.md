I live in London with my girlfriend, Evi, and our cat, Gus. I am originally from Muenster, Germany.

I spend most of my time building [Heron Data](https://www.herondata.io/) with my friends and co-founders Dom and Jamie. We help lenders underwrite businesses, allowing them to take into account much more information about the business than previously possible. This makes it easier for the businesses to get credit.

In my spare time, I play football, chess and work out.
